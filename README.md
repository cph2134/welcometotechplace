# welcometotechplace

I imagined I worked in HR for a tech startup and wanted to create a webpage to use as part of a new employee orientation. The idea would be to have employees watch a fun video introducing them to the culture and best practices at the startup and then take a quiz on what they learned.

I couldn't find any good example videos, so instead I used a clip from The Office and some made up questions.

If I were to build this page (or realistically oversee someone else building it, which is more likely how my eventual job will work) I would of course have a log in so that employees would get credit for watching it, and probably also have additional content like workplace policies, etc.
